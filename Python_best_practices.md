# Best Practices

- One virtual environment per project
  - Isolation
  - Different projects have different dependency versions
  - You don't want to mess up the system Python
- Structure your code and projects
  - Package and module structure gives an overview about the project
  - Modular design == better re-usability
- Utilize the capabilities of your editor
  - Efficient and fluent development
  - There's plenty of tools to make your daily programming easier, why would you not use them
- Use existing solutions
  - Python Standard Library is extensive - and stable!
  - There are 370k+ packages in PyPI
  - Someone has most likely solved the problem you're trying to solve
  - Spend 5 minutes doing a web search before starting to solve a new problem
- Learn how to debug efficiently
  - You won't write completely stable code anyway - impossible looking conditions will occur
  - When something is not working as expected, there are plenty of tools out there to help you figure out what's going on
- Test your code
  - No surprises (especially in production)
  - Make sure that everything works as expected
  - Make sure that old stuff works as expected after introducing new features (regression)
  - Tests give you confidence while refactoring
  - Good tests demonstrate the use cases of application, i.e. they also document the implementation
- Write high quality code
  - Easy to read
  - Better maintainability
  - Better quality == less bugs
- Use continuous integration and deployment
  - Make sure the tests pass
  - CI is the place where it's possible to run also some time consuming tests which the impatient developers prefer to skip on their local machines
  - Make sure there's no linting errors
  - Ideally, the place to test against all target versions and platforms
  - Overall, CI is the last resort for automatically ensuring the quality
  - Manual deployments are time consuming and error-prone, CD is automated and deterministic
  - You want to automate as much as possible, human time is expensive
  - Minimize the time required for code reviews, what could be detected with automatic tools, should be detected by using those tools, human time is expensive
- Declutter the repo with `.gitignore`
- No passwords in the code: use configuration files or environment variables
- Have a README.md[.rst]
- If you use third-party libraries, have a requirements.txt/Pipfile/pyproject.toml
- Format your code
- Remove unused imports
- Remove unused variables
- Follow PEP-8 naming conventions
